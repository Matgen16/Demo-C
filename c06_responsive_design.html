        <h2>Responsive Design</h2>

        <p>While working through wireframes of your Website, you should keep in mind that some Website visitors will be using vertically-oriented touchscreens (like phones and tablets) and other visitors will be sitting at desktop computers with relatively wide screens and they may not have touch capabilities. The current design mantra is a "mobile first" approach. Most Internet traffic around the world is mobile-based. Assuming your Website is going to share this trend, it makes sense to design the mobile experience first and make it the most satisfying.</p>
        <p>But what about the other screen types?</p>
        <p>There are 3 basic approaches to the need for responsivity in design:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                fixed
                <ul>
                    <li>page layout is designed around the most common screen width in your target market</li>
                    <li>no matter the display used by the visitor, they will get the same layout and width - even if that means they'll have to scroll back and forth to see it all</li>
                    <li>element sizes are typically defined in terms of pixels</li>
                    <li>although this is the easiest way to code a Website, it is not favored because it does not reliably produce good user experiences</li>
                </ul>
            </li>

            <li>
                fluid
                <ul>
                    <li>sometimes called a 'liquid' layout</li>
                    <li>element sizes are typically defined in terms of percentages</li>
                    <li>elements will re-size automatically to share available screen space</li>
                    <li>images do not change in size, but text can flow dynamically around the images as needed</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                elastic
                <ul>
                    <li>element sizes are typically defined in terms of percentages</li>
                    <li>Web page appearance is defined by the user's screen dimensions</li>
                    <li>element positioning remains unchanged by the resizing </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Many Web designers combine multiple approaches to achieve the look and responsivity they (or their client) desire.</p>
        <p>Web designs may also be:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>responsive
                <ul>
                    <li>reflects a 'mobile first' design philosophy</li>
                    <li>element sizes are typically defined in terms of percentages, ems, or rems</li>
                    <li>layout will change based on visitor device type (can switch from one layout to another as needed)</li>
                </ul>
            <li>adaptive
                <ul>
                    <li>reflects a 'mobile first' design philosophy</li>
                    <li>essentially identical to responsive layout, however it will change layout based on visitor device screen width rather than device type</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
