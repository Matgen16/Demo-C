        <h2>Wireframing and Web Design</h2>

        <p>A wireframe is a boxy sketch showing the intended layout of each Web page. Lorem Ipsum is commonly used for placeholder text when designing so that you can see whether your content will be crowded or difficult to read even before you have actual content to add.</p>
        
        <p>Code editors (like <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">VS Code</a>) and Integrated Development Environments (like <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/">IntelliJ IDEA</a>) frequently have ways of quickly inserting Lorem Ipsum elements as needed. If you are going to mock up a Website by directly coding it, you should read up on how to make this work for you.</p>
        
        <p>Ideally, you want to include your color palette in your wireframe. Once we learn how to code <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> Grid, this will be an easy thing to do. For now, however, it will take some patience on your part while you are using tools such as <a href = https://docs.google.com/drawings>Google Drawing</a> to wireframe your pages.</p>
