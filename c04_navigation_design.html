        <h2>Navigation Design</h2>

        <p>Remember these basic guidelines when designing your navigation:</p>
        <ul>

            <li>make it obvious - nobody wants to hunt for your navigation</li>
            <li>put it in the same location on every page in your site
                <ul>
                    <li>across the top is the most common option</li>
                    <li>down the left side is the second most common option</li>
                    <li>across the bottom is only used in rare cases where content is minimal or as a secondary or tertiary navigation for less-commonly-sought destinations</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>text-based navigation works well for search engine optimization (SEO), which will drive more traffic to your Website</li>
            <li>icon-based navigation is often a smart compromise for mobile design</li>
            <li>graphics-based navigation is not robust and is difficult to make universally accessible, but it is possible and you will see it from time to time, especially on game and movie sites from the 1990s</li>
            <li>large sites benefit from drop-down menus (nested navigation) and may also employ breadcrumb navigation (where visitors can see the way they navigated through the site to get there)</li>
            <li>large sites may also employ site maps or search bars to make it easier for visitors to navigate</li>
